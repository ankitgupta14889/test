# Terraformer

It's a CLI tool that generates `tf` and `tfstate` files based on the existing infrastructure.

## Capabilities

1.  Generate `tf` and `tfstate` files from existing infrastructure for all the
    resources.
2.  Remote state will be uploaded to S3 bucket.
3.  Connect between resources with `terraform_remote_state` (local and bucket).
4.  Save `tf` files using a custom folder tree pattern.
5.  Import by resource name and type.
6.  Support terraform 0.13 (for terraform 0.11 use v0.7.9).

Terraformer uses Terraform providers and is designed to easily support newly added resources.
To upgrade resources with new fields, all we need to do is upgrade the relevant Terraform providers.

#### Permissions

The tool requires read-only permissions to list service resources.

#### Resources

We can use `--resources` parameter to tell resources from what service you want to import.

To import resources from all services, use `--resources="*"` . If we want to exclude certain services, We can combine the parameter with `--excludes` to exclude resources from services we don't want to import e.g. `--resources="*" --excludes="iam"`.

#### Filtering

Filters are a way to choose which resources `terraformer` imports. It's possible to filter resources by its identifiers or attributes.

Use `Type` when we need to filter only one of several types of resources. Multiple filters can be combined when importing different resource types. Below an example would be importing all AWS security groups from a specific AWS VPC:
```
terraformer import aws -r sg,vpc --filter Type=sg;Name=vpc_id;Value=VPC_ID --filter Type=vpc;Name=id;Value=VPC_ID
```
We can notice how the `Name` is different for `sg` than it is for `vpc`.


##### Resource ID

Filtering is based on Terraform resource ID patterns. To find valid ID patterns for the resource, check the import part of the [Terraform documentation][terraform-providers].

[terraform-providers]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/

#### Planning

The `plan` command generates a planfile that contains all the resources set to be imported. By modifying the planfile before running the `import` command, we can rename or filter the resources we'd like to import.

The rest of the subcommands and parameters are identical to the `import` command.
